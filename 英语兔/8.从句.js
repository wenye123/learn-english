  1. 思维&构成
    1. 在中文中定语都是放在被修饰的名词/代词之前, 结构为: 形容词/句子+的
      兔子正在吃一根(我买来的)胡萝卜
      一只几个月前开始在B站上传视频专门教英语的讨人喜欢的兔子
    2. 英语中，形容词类是前置的, 句子则是先行词+关系词+。。
      1. 例子
        a carrot that i bought
        the rabbit is eating a carrot that i bought;
        this is a rabbit who starred uoloading videos since at few months ago to focus on English teaching and is liked by many students;
      2. 关系词
        1. 关系代词 
          1. 指人: who(主格) whom(宾格) whose(所有格) 
            the techer who is a rabbit; -- 一个是兔子的老师
            the teacher whom I saw yesterday; -- 一个我昨天看见的老师
            the teacher whose favorite food is carrot; -- 一个最喜欢食物是胡萝卜的老师
          2. 指人指物: that which
            the rabbit is eating a carrot that i bought; -- 先行词是唯一的用that
            the food which the teacher likes is a carrot; -- 先行词是多选一用which，也可以用that
        2. 关系副词
          1. 表时间: when = on+which 
            the day when/(on which) the rabbit ate the carrot for the first time; -- 表时间
          2. 表地点: where = at+which 
            the place where/(at which) the rabiit ate the carrot; -- 表地点
          3. 表原因: why = for+which 
            the reason why/(for which) the rabiit ate the carrot; -- 表原因
  2. 限定性和非限定性
    1. 限定性 - 多种选一
      I have a head which is round; -- 我有很多头 其中一个是圆的
    2. 非限定性 - 只有一个 
      1. 通常做插入语 直接去掉也不影响句子含义
        I have a head, which is round; -- 我(只)有一个头 而这个头是圆的
        The biggest carrot, which the rabbit ate, was on the table; -- 最大的胡萝卜曾在桌子上 兔子吃了它
          这里不能修改去掉逗号The biggest和限定性冲突
      2. 指代整句话
        the rabbit ate the carrot, which was not surprising;

        where the rabbit ate the carrot is obvious;

      3. 否定加在谓语动词前，而非从句中

        I knew that the rabbit liked carrot;
        I knew that the sun rises in the east; -- 这里客观现实 rises不用过去式

      2. 在时间点之中: when while as

      3. 在某时间点之后: after
        the rabbit ate a carrot aftr the wolf stopped by;
      4. 从之前某一时间点开始算起(暗示对之后有影响，所以一般用完成时态): since

      1. 如果: if
        if the rabbit sees a carrot, he will eat it;
      2. 如果的相反: unless
        if you dont like this video, you will not give it a coin;

      2. as: 就好像 但表假设
        eat the carrot as I do;
          eat the carrot the way (in which) I eat it; -- 定语从句表达

        the more coins you give me, the more videos I make;
    7. 表原因
      1. 因为: because -- 引导的从句可以放主句前后
        the rabbit ate the carrot because he was hungry;
          because the rabbit was hungry, he ate a carrot -- 同样because后面不能加so 因为主句不需要一个连接词
          you must really like me, for you have given all my videos a coin; 
            - for这里不是引导原因状语从句 而是构成一个复合句
            - because表示因果 这里表示推测的结果+这么推测的原因
      2. 既然: since/as(引导的从句只能到主句前，而且因果语气上 because>since>as), now that
        since you are hungry, you can eat the carrot;

        I ate a lot of carrots for lunch so that I wasnt hungry at all;
          I like this video, so I will give it a coin; -- 这里是so引导的复合句 是不是结果状语从句

        It was such a tasty carrot that I ate it all at once;
          It was so tasty a carrot that I ate it all at once;
